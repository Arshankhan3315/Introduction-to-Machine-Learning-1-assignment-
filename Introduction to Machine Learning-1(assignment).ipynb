    "# Answer-1-Artificial Intelligence (AI):Artificial Intelligence is a broad field of computer science that focuses on creating systems or machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. AI encompasses various techniques and approaches to simulate human-like cognitive functions such as reasoning, problem-solving, learning, perception, and natural language understanding. AI systems can be rule-based, expert systems, or machine learning-based, and they can adapt and improve their performance over time.\n",

    "# Deep Learning:Deep Learning is a subfield of machine learning that specializes in neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks). These networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, and they are particularly effective at handling complex tasks involving large amounts of data, such as image and speech recognition. Deep learning has gained significant attention due to its ability to automatically extract relevant features from raw data and perform tasks at a level of accuracy that often surpasses traditional machine learning methods.\n",
    "# Example: Image recognition using deep learning is a prime example. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of deep neural network, have been instrumental in tasks like identifying objects in images. For instance, a deep learning system can be trained to recognize cats in photographs by learning the patterns and features that define a cat's appearance, such as edges, shapes, and textures, from a massive dataset of labeled cat images."
